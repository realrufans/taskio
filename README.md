# What is TelosTask?
[Telostask](https://telostask.app/login) is a freelance marketplace for micro and macro tasks listing and work completion with an intuitive user experience integrated on the blockchain for work transparency, job improvement, job opportunities, easy workflow, rich tokenomics, sustainable business plan and provision of solutions to the biggest shortcoming of the traditional platforms.
# The Utility/ Governance Features of the Task Token
The Task Token is a utility token on the Telos Task platform which gives you access to the full range of the platformâ€™s services. There are 100 million Task Tokens in total supply, with 16 % (16m) allocated to the Team, 20% (20m) for Development, 40% (40m) for ITO, 20% (20m) for Marketing, 1% (1m) for AirDrop and 3% (3m) unallocated for now. The Task Token is deflationary in nature and will increase in monetary value as there will be a decrease in total token supply overtime. It will gradually deflate from a 100% initial token supply distribution to a reduced 60% total token supply because token burns will occur monthly or on specific dates. The tokens to be burned will be taken from 50% of task listing fees and sometimes from unallocated tokens in cases of unallocated or no token usage.

# Who's behind Telostask?
The Telos Task platform was crafted by the [Mydappr](Mydappr.io) team as a marketplace for micro and macro tasks listings by Task Givers, and work completion by Task Takers or Freelancers.
